# Smart Zone Detection and Actuation system
 Creating a Smart Zone Detection and Actuation system involves several components, including hardware and software. Given the complexity of the project, providing a complete code is not feasible in this format, but I can guide you on how to approach it. Below is a simplified outline of the steps and components involved. Please note that this is a generic guide, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements.  Hardware Components: Arduino Board:  Choose an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano) as the brain of your system. RFID Module:  Use an RFID module (e.g., MFRC522) to read RFID tags or smart cards. Motor Driver:  Employ a motor driver (e.g., L298N) to control motors that simulate signal functions. RF Transmitter and Receiver:  Implement RF transmitter and receiver modules (e.g., 433MHz) for communication between the demo vehicle and signaling infrastructure. LEDs or Servo Motors:  Connect LEDs or servo motors to represent signal functions. Power Supply:  Provide a suitable power supply for your components. Software Components: Arduino IDE:  Install the Arduino IDE on your computer. RFID Library:  Integrate an RFID library for Arduino, such as the "MFRC522" library. RF Communication Library:  Include a library for RF communication (e.g., "VirtualWire" for 433MHz modules). Motor Control Library:  If needed, include a motor control library (e.g., "Servo.h" for servo motors).
